# Fall-detetction-using-Imu-s
This project is machine learning project that detect falls in individual using reading from accelerometer and gyroscope.


Model1
 
add magnitude.py -This file is just adding magnitude to the data i.e. total accleration and total gyroscope 
Cnn.py- In this file neurak network is implmented on the data
Knn.py-In this file K- nearest neighbour is implmented on the data
randomforest.py-In this file random forest is implmented on the data
decisiontree.py-In this file decision tree is implmented on the data
svm.py-In this file svm is implmented on the data
Converttocsv.py- As data was in txt file so to read data properly it was convertes into csv file
Classifier.py- It consist of svm,random forest,decison tree and Svm implemented together

Model 2

model.py-In this file neurak network is implmented on the data
